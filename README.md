# Flow Types for Material UI

This is an attempt to build Flow types for material-ui that are more precise than the one built in the `flow-typed` repository.
I'm looking for help to map some TypeScript types to Flow.

For instance how does the following TS definition:

```
React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>
```

translate in Flow? ðŸ¤”
